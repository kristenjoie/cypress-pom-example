## 📖 Code Structure

For this example of Page Object Model we have organize files as follows:

**cypress.config.js**  
First generated by Cypress, this file contains configuration you do to set Cypress and your test environment

Here we have only define the app url:
```javascript
module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    env: {
      url: 'https://example.cypress.io'
    }
  }
});
```

**cypress/e2e/\***  
This folder contains all spec file for end-to-end tests.

**cypress/support/page\***  
Contains page object files. Each file contains the description of a specific page of the app to be tested.
There a is '*special*' file, `'base.page.js'` which is a description of all the common actions available to any other page of the app. In our example, all actions related the navbar header.
